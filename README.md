# ⚡ Learning FastAPI  

Hey there! 👋  
I’ve started learning **FastAPI** as part of my journey to strengthen my backend development skills — especially in **Python**.  

I’m shifting toward **Python backend development** to design and implement the backend architecture for my **aspiring startup idea**, which I’ll be working on soon. FastAPI feels like the perfect framework for that — lightweight, modern, and incredibly fast 🚀  

Currently, I’m exploring and practicing FastAPI through an amazing **19-hour tutorial on the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) YouTube channel** — which, by the way, is one of the best free resources to learn anything tech-related!  
*(And no, this isn’t a sponsored video yet 😄)*

### 🧩 Why FastAPI?  
I chose **FastAPI** after comparing it with other Python frameworks such as:
- **Django** (for full-stack web apps)
- **Flask** (for minimal setups)
- **FastAPI** (for performance, modern syntax, and async capabilities)

It fits perfectly for building **modern, scalable, and API-driven applications**, which aligns with my long-term vision for developing production-level backend systems.

### 🧠 What I’m Learning  
- Building RESTful APIs with FastAPI  
- Using **SQLAlchemy ORM** with **PostgreSQL**  
- Schema validation with **Pydantic**  
- CRUD operations, dependency injection, and request handling  
- Structuring backend projects like real-world applications

### 🌱 Current Focus  
Expanding my knowledge in **Python frameworks** and **modern backend design**, while keeping my existing expertise in the **MERN stack**, **Java**, and **data-driven technologies** sharp.

### 💬 Final Note  
Thank you for taking your precious time to read this ❤️  
Stick around — something amazing is in the making!
